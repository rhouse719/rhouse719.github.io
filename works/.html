<h1 id="The Slander of Richard Stallman">The Slander of Richard Stallman</h1>
<p>
Messages from an MIT mailing list sent between 2019-09-10 and 2019-09-12 were leaked. In these messages, Stallman made several comments and arguments about his long time friend Marvin Minsky, who was involved in the Epstein scandal. This was followed by several slanderous articles about those comments, which misrepresented what Stallman said.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Vice Article</b>
</p>
<p>
The Vice article linked above, written by pretend journalist Edward Ongweso Jr, contains several lies about Stallman's statements. The first is this:
</p>
<p>
&gt; Early in the thread, Stallman insists that the “most plausible scenario” is that Epstein’s underage victims were “entirely willing” while being trafficked. 
</p>
<p>
This is a clear misrepresentation of what Stallman actually said in the email thread:
</p>
<p>
&gt; We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates.
</p>
<p>
There are two key differences:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
Stallman is talking about Giuffre in particular, but Ongweso claimed that Stallman was talking about "Epstein's underage victims." Notice the "s" on "victims."
</li>
<li>
Stallman never said that Giuffre 
<i>was</i>
<a href=" willing as Ongweso claims"></a>
, just that she 
<i>presented</i>
 herself as willing. These are two very different statements.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It's always a red flag when the writer clipping very small quotes out of context like this. If he wanted his audience to 
<i>actually</i>
 know what Stallman said, he'd just quote the entire paragraph as I did above. Instead he writes his own narrative around two out of context quotes to make it seem like Stallman said something he didn't. Ongweso's next misrepresentation was as follows:
</p>
<p>
&gt; Stallman goes on to argue about the definition of “sexual assault,” “rape,” and whether they apply to Minsky and Giuffre’s deposition statement that she was forced to have sex with him.
</p>
<p>
Again Ongweso has misrepresented Stallman's actual statement. Stallman's statement about the term "sexual assault":
</p>
<p>
&gt; The injustice is in the word "assaulting". The term "sexual assault" is so vague and slipper that it facilitates accusation inflation: taking claims that someone did X and leading people to think of it as Y, which is much worse than X.
</p>
<p>
As the first statement from Stallman makes obvious, he wasn't arguing about whether the term assault, by its legal definition, applies to this case. He is arguing that it is irresponsible to use the term because it invokes in a reader a very different event from what actually took place. He makes that quite obvious here: "taking claims that someone did X and leading people to think of it as Y, which is much worse than X." Ongweso's claim is basically accurate with regards to Stallman's statements about the term "rape":
</p>
<p>
&gt; Does it really? I think it is morally absurd to define "rape" in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Medium Article</b>
</p>
<p>
Mentioned in the Vice article is another article on Medium written by Selam Jie Gano. While I think Gano says some dumb things in this article, I don't think it's even half as egregious as the Vice article. First, Gano is an engineer. She's not a journalist, she's not pretending to be a journalist. Despite that, her article is still far more honest than Ongweso's. After a trigger warning and a brief explanation of why she wrote the article, she gives Stallman's quote in full. She doesn't try to misrepresent him by clipping a few words or phrases out of context.
</p>
<p>
&gt; Richard Stallman was known to be problematic long before this. This is the door to his office.
</p>
<p>
<a href="Following this is an image of the room number/name plate of Stallman's office. It has "RICHARD STALLMAN: KNIGHT FOR JUSTICE ALSO: HOT LADIES"></a>
" written on it. She's doesn't state it explicitly, but clearly the implication is that Stallman wrote this and that he is problematic for having done so. Of course, I would be inclined to agree, except the sign wasn't actually written by Stallman:
</p>
<p>
&gt; Look at his real history — not the sign about welcoming “hot ladies” on his MIT Media lab office door, which someone else wrote as a joke and which he removed but not before someone took a photo of it — but his record in helping to give everyone in the world access to free software.
</p>

From 
<a href="https://medium.com/@whoisylvia/richard-stallman-has-been-vilified-by-those-who-dont-know-him-a3907b25b4c7">Sylvia Paull's Medium</a>
</p>
<p>
&gt; There is no single person that is so deserving of praise their comments deprecating others should be allowed to slide. Particularly when those comments are excuses about rape, assault, and child sex trafficking.
</p>
<p>
Except that's not true. Stallman didn't excuse "rape, assault, and child sex trafficking." He never argues with the claims being made against Minsky by Giuffre. He only states that the terms used by some to describe Minsky's actions are misleading to people reading them. Which is potentially true. I can't claim to have read any studies on the matter, but I could easily see how the use of terms like "assault" and "rape" could lead a reader to the belief that something far more heinous took place. It seems to me that Stallman was simply suggesting that when describing the accusations against Minsky, one ought to be more specific and to not use easily misunderstood terms like "assault" and "rape."

</p>
<p>
&gt; What’s more, the woman would probably be less egotistical and more team-oriented about it.
</p>
<p>
Unrelated to the primary discussion about Stallman's comments, but I couldn't help but laugh at this comment. Fight fire with fire and sexism with sexism.

<b>Transcript of Stallman's Comments</b>

<div class="codeBlock">
The announcement of the Friday event does an injustice to Marvin
<br>
Minsky:
<br>

<br>
deceased AI "pioneer" Marvin Minsky (who is accused of assaulting
<br>
one of Epstein's victims [2])
<br>

<br>
The injustice is in the word "assaulting". The term "sexual assault"
<br>
is so vague and slipper that it facilitates accusation inflation:
<br>
taking claims that someone did X and leading people to think of it as
<br>
Y, which is much worse than X.
<br>

<br>
The accusation quoted is a clear example of inflation. The reference
<br>
reports the claim that Minsky had sex with one of Eptein's harem.
<br>
(See 
<br>
https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffery-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed
<br>

<br>
.)
<br>
Let's presume that was true (I see no reason to disbelieve it).
<br>

<br>
The word "assaulting" presumes that he applied force or violence, in
<br>
some unspecified way, but the article itself says no such thing.
<br>
Only that they had sex.
<br>

<br>
We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that
<br>
she presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was
<br>
being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her
<br>
to conceal that from most of his associates.
<br>

<br>
I've concluded that various examples of accusation inflation that it
<br>
is absolutely wrong to use the term "sexual assault" in an accusation.
<br>

<br>
Whatever conduct you want to criticize, you should describe it with a 
<br>
specific term that avoids moral vagueness about the nature of the
<br>
criticism.

<div class="codeBlock">
&gt; Giuffre was 17 at the time;this makes it __rape__ in the Virgin Islands.
<br>

<br>
Does it really? I think it is morally absurd to define "rape" in a
<br>
way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or
<br>
whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.
<br>

<br>
I think the existence of a dispute about that supports my point that
<br>
the term "sexual assault" is slippery, so we ought to use more
<br>
concrete terms when accusing anyone.
<br>

<br>
&gt; The verge article includes the deposition snippet, which is not
<br>
&gt; ambiguous at all: Giuffre directly says she was force to have sex
<br>
&gt; with Minsky.
<br>

<br>
I don't see any quotation from the deposition in the article, but it 
<br>
says, "Giuffre says she was directed to have sex with Minsky." Given
<br>
the circumstances, that implies she was coerced by Epstein into doing
<br>
so.
<br>

<br>
The article I know of, and have a copy of is
<br>
https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffery-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed.
<br>
Are you talking of some other Verge article? If so, would you like to tell me its URL?
<br>

<br>
&gt; Let's stop grasping at straws to defend our friends, and instead
<br>
&gt; listen to the women who were harmed.
<br>

<br>
We can only listen to what is said to us.
<br>

<br>
All I know she said about Minsky is that Epstein directed her to have
<br>
sex with Minsky. That does not say whether Minsky knew that she was
<br>
coerced. It does not report what each said and did during their
<br>
sexual encounter. We can imagine various scenarios.
<br>

<br>
Looking through the article again carefully, I found a link that
<br>
reportedly points to the deposition itself. I visited that URL and
<br>
got a blank window. It is on Google Drive, which demands running
<br>
nonfree software in order to see it. See
<br>
https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html.
<br>

<br>
Would you (not anyone else!) like to email me a copy of the part that pertains to Minsky? I say "not anyone else" to avoid getting 20 copies.

<b>Other Useful Comments from the Thread</b>

<div class="codeBlock">
The NYT misused ambiguity, but so did the Verge. I give credence to
<br>
Giuffre. But as far as I can see in the deposition she only states that
<br>
she was *directed* to have sex with Minsky, and that she *did* have sex
<br>
with various people. She does not explicitly state that Minsky was one
<br>
of the people she had sex with. After asking how she was directed to
<br>
have sex with Minsky, the lawyer does ask a followup question "where did
<br>
you go to have sex with Minsky" but having been deposed I know it is
<br>
easy to answer what you *think* the lawyer is asking instead of what
<br>
they *actually* asked, and she may have been responding to the part of
<br>
his followup question about location without realizing that the language
<br>
had shifted from "directed to have sex" to "actually did".

For the record, a witness denies this saying that Minsky turned her down:
