<h2 id="does-the-geneva-protocol-actually-ban-the-use-of-tear-gas">Does the Geneva Protocol actually ban the use of tear gas?</h2>
<p>The following is the “Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (1925)”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The undersigned Plenipotentiaries, in the name of their respective governments: Whereas the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world; and</p>
<p>Whereas the prohibition of such use has been declared in Treaties to which the majority of Powers of the world are Parties; and</p>
<p>To the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of International Law, binding alike the conscience and the practice of nations;</p>
<p>Declare:</p>
<p>That the High Contracting Parties, so far as they are not already Parties to Treaties prohibiting such use, accept this prohibition, agree to extend this prohibition to the use of bacteriological methods of warfare and agree to be bound as between themselves according to the terms of this declaration.</p>
<p>The High Contracting Parties will exert every effort to induce other States to accede to the present Protocol. Such accession will be notified to the Government of the French Republic, and by the latter to all signatories and acceding Powers, and will take effect on the date of the notification by the Government of the French Republic.</p>
<p>The present Protocol, of which the English and French texts are both authentic, shall be ratified as soon as possible. It shall bear to-day’s date.</p>
<p>The ratifications of the present Protocol shall be addressed to the Government of the French Republic, which will at once notify the deposit of such ratification to each of the signatory and acceding Powers.</p>
<p>The instruments of ratification of and accession to the present Protocol will remain deposited in the archives of the Government of the French Republic.</p>
<p>The present Protocol will come into force for each signatory Power as from the date of deposit of its ratification, and, from that moment, each Power will be bound as regards other Powers which have already deposited their ratifications.</p>
<p>In witness whereof the Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Protocol.</p>
<p>Done at Geneva in a single copy, the seventeenth day of June, One Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-Five.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of particular relevance is the phrase “the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases” This phrasing has two key implications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It includes all gases, including tear gas.</li>
<li>It only applies to use in war, excluding use by a country as “riot control.”</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="does-this-apply-to-the-united-states">Does this apply to the United States?</h2>
<p>To become party to the protocol, a country’s head of state must sign an “instrument of ratification,” a document stating that the country is ratifying the protocol, and deposit it with France. Countries are able to opt-in with “reservations,” conditions under which they will be able to ignore the protocol.</p>
<p>The United States signed on 1925-06-17 and deposited the instrument on 1975-04-10. The US had one reservation, that the protocol would not apply to use of chemical weapons against countries that themselves used chemicals weapons.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200206204216/http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/a/1925/unitedstatesofamerica/rat/paris">United States of America: Ratification of 1925 Geneva Protocol</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States ratified this Protocol on January 22, 1975 with the proviso that “said Protocol shall cease to be binding on the United States Government with respect to the use in warfare of asphyxiating, poisonous and other gases and all liquids, materials or similar devices with regard to an enemy State if the said State or any of its allies does not respect the prohibitions contained in the protocol”.</p>

<h2 id="the-un-chemical-weapons-convention">The UN Chemical Weapons Convention</h2>
<p>The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, or simply the <a href="https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC), is an agreement “to eliminate an entire category of weapons of mass destruction by prohibiting the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of chemical weapons by States Parties.”</p>
<p>The United States signed on 1993-01-13 and deposited on 1997-04-25.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210226135400/https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention">Archive</a></p>
<p>The CWC refers to chemicals like tear gas specifically and calls them “riot control agents,” which it defines as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any chemical not listed in a Schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three sections relevant to the use of riot control agents. The first states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each State Party has the right, subject to the provisions of this Convention, to develop, produce, otherwise acquire, retain, transfer and use toxic chemicals and their precursors for purposes not prohibited under this Convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And one such purpose not prohibited under the CWC is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only context in which riot control agents <em>are</em> banned is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>So, just to be clear, if another country invades the US, it would be illegal to tear gas those guys, but there’s nothing in either the Geneva Protocol or the Chemical Weapons Convention that says you can’t use it on your own civilian population.</p>
