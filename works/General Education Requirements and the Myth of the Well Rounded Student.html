<p>Written: 2017-11-21</p>
<p>If you went to an American university, you probably had to take some classes that: A) had nothing to do with your degree, and B) you really didn’t like. These General Education classes (GenEds) also frequently cause students to stay in school for four years rather than three. Given all this, it seems odd administrators would continue to require them. The reasoning for them is usually this: we want our students to be “well-rounded” individuals. This is, of course, a lie. Students learn very little in these classes that will actually stick with them. Think back on your High School and College classes, how much do you remember of these kinds of classes? Unless you happen to be a chemist, a science teacher, or a chemical engineer, you probably don’t remember an awful lot of chemistry. It doesn’t have to be this way though.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to throw the baby out with the bath water and get rid of GenEds altogether, but recently I’ve taken a different view. My line of thinking is this: how can we fix GenEds to actually accomplish their stated goal, that is to make students more “well-rounded.” Clearly, we need to first define “well-rounded.” My own view is that it means to foster an interest in and understanding of fields outside of and unrelated to a students chosen field of study.</p>
<p>The next step is to understand why GenEds as they currently exist fail to do that. The answer is simple: grades. I came to this conclusion after listening to a few lectures given by Alfie Kohn, who is strongly opposed to grades as they are currently used. Grading GenEds means that students will only be concerned with the grades. When it comes to classes in a student’s field of study grades have less of an effect on students’ learning. This is because students already have an interest in that field and know that they will need that knowledge for future classes and in their career, so they are motivated to actually learn rather than just give the minimal amount of effort to get by. They are also more likely to take electives that are useful or interesting. Compare this to GenEds, where students gravitate towards the easiest possible classes.</p>
<p>I can think of no better example of this than my own freshman art class. I chose it because I had heard it was easy. I can only assume the other nine hundred or so students had similar reasons. Yes, you read that correctly, it was a class of over 900 students in a 1000 seat lecture hall. The lectures were given over a microphone and quizzes used a system of wireless remotes. Attendance in this class (and many like it) was terrible. The quizes had been introduced for this very reason, but had failed utterly. Most students still didn’t bother to show up, as the quizzes were only worth a small portion of our grades. Those that did show up would leave right after the quiz was given. While this particular class was the most egregious, there were similar classes I had to take for biology, chemistry, psychology, sociology, and english. These classes were all poorly taught, because honestly, how can one teach a class of a few hundred? They can’t and they don’t. They just talk at their students for an hour and a half; there is no teaching being done.</p>
<p>The solution is to get rid of grades (mostly). Since they aren’t actually going to be using these classes in a future career, it isn’t super important to make sure they learn everything. Again, we need to focus on our goal, to make them more well rounded. By getting rid of grades, student priorities go from finding the easiest possible class, to the most interesting. We can reinforce this by replacing grades with attendance. If a student has too many unexcused absences they fail. Since, they have to sit in the class anyway, they are going to pick something that actually sounds interesting. Getting rid of grades isn’t enough by itself, though. Most of these classes are taught as lectures, which would just result in students taking naps during classes. These big lecture based classes need to be replaced with classes that will hold student attention. One option is hands on experiences. For the physical and life sciences this means labs, for art it means actual art classes, for social science, perhaps some kind of research experience could be done. Another option would be small class discussions led by a professor with passion for the subject matter. To further reinforce participation in these classes (particularly the discussions) it could be made a component of their grade. By doing hands on work students get an idea of what these fields are about, and are more likely to take something away from the experience.</p>
