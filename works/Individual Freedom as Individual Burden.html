<p>Written: 2017-12-01</p>
<p>In the United States there is an obsession with individual freedom, but what many fail to realize (or at least underestimate the impact of) is that individual freedom also means individual burden. In this essay I’d like to talk about this relationship and how it makes our transportation system worse. Individual freedom may sound like a good thing, but the individual burden is almost always worse than the collective burden on average. For a physical example imagine one person trying to move a heavy and unwieldy object versus six people trying to move six heavy and unwieldy objects. If a person is exceptionally strong then the first scenario may be better for them, but on average the second scenario will be easier to manage for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Despite the US’s obsession with “freedom,” we still have a number of systems that have been centralized or collectivized. For example: water. Could you imagine an individual water treatment system? Every home would have to have in it a micro water treatment facility. The cost would be enormous and they would take up far more room. Who would even consider such a thing? And yet we don’t blink an eye when it comes to personal transportation.</p>
<p>Cars are absurdly expensive when compared to public transit and for the average commuter rarely save time when taking into account the traffic caused by an urban population mostly relying on cars. Trains and buses are considerably more efficient in almost every way. Other advantages include the ability to do other things during your commute (since you aren’t driving) and fewer transportation related injuries (which contribute to higher costs in the form of medical/funeral bills).</p>
<p>But what about the rural people, you ask? Well of course they will need personal rather than collective solutions, but the reality is that most developed countries are heavily urbanized and few people actually need these solutions. Fewer still have legitimate reasons for needing to live in rural areas in the first place. The U.S. and Canada, which have massive amounts of land, are at 82% urbanization by recent estimates. Ok, but what if I need to get somewhere right now? Again this is pretty rare and there’s no reason a good transit system couldn’t include taxis (plus ambulances would still exist).</p>
<p>So why is it that we have such an expensive system? Privatization. Many will tell you that corporations run things more efficiently than governments. To a degree this is true; the problem with this, however, is in what it leaves out. It leaves out the answer to the question “What are they more efficient at?” And the answer is: generating profits. So corporations are good at decreasing costs, but only at decreasing costs to themselves, not to the end user and not to society at large. Businesses will take any opportunity to push costs onto customers if it will increase profits. Some would argue that competition is able to keep prices low, but this is a fantasy. First of all, no amount of competition is going to make our current system more efficient that a good public transit system. Second of all, these companies work hard to ensure that they experience no competition. They naturally trend towards monopolies and will lobby (read bribe) politicians to ensure they are allowed to do so. They will buy up competition with the intent to dismantle it (GM did this in a number of US cities). If their competition is publicly run they will fund politicians who will campaign on the idea that public systems are less efficient or somehow inferior. If and when these politicians get into office they get to work dismantling or sabotaging the systems they claimed were inferior and in doing so prove that they were right all along. The system now IS inferior, not because it is naturally inferior, but because they made it that way. Do not fall for such rhetoric. Nor should you fall for it when they try to claim a system is inferior by pointing to an example of a system that is run poorly. One could easily get the idea that public transportation is ineffective if they only look at Los Angeles or New Orleans, but look at New York, Seoul, or Tokyo and you’ll see a different story. The average delay for trains in Tokyo is around 40 seconds and a 5 minute delay is grounds for an official apology to be issued. Can you imagine that level of efficiency as a driver in a major US city? I can’t.</p>
