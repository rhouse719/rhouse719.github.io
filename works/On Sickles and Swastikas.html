<p>Written: 2015-06-01</p>
<p>I’ve noticed many people recently compare communist’s and socialist’s use of the hammer and sickle to the Nazi’s use of the swastika. The argument goes that if the use of the swastika is representative of the atrocities committed by the Nazi’s (the holocaust), then the hammer and sickle must represent those atrocities committed by the Soviet Union (The Holodomor and the Great Purge). By extension, the people who use these symbols are expressing tacit approval of the actions. In response, I must first ask a question: if the previous statements are true, then does the use of the American Flag represent tacit approval of Slavery? Native American Genocide? Japanese Internment? Jim Crow? Some might say yes (and if so, fair enough), but most would not. This is because those previous two statements are based on a faulty assumption: that the use of iconography represents an approval of the <em>actions</em> of those who originated the iconography (in that context). It does not. It does however represent an approval of and association with their <em>ideology</em>.</p>
<p>This is the important distinction between the Nazi and Soviet iconography. Use of the swastika doesn’t <em>necessarily</em> represent approval of the Holocaust, but you can be pretty confident it represents approval of Nazism. The same is true of the hammer and sickle. If you see a person or organization using the hammer and sickle and you can be certain they are a socialist or communist, but that doesn’t mean they approve of the purges or Holodomor. If you don’t believe me see for your self. Go onto any Nazi internet forum and you will see racism, sexism, homophobia, antisemitism, etc, but you’d be hard pressed to find this kind of hateful ideology in a communist forum. The worst you might find is a call for violent uprising against an oppressor.</p>
<p>We can see the same dichotomy with the American and Confederate flags. Those who fly the Confederate Flag (or battle flag or whatever pedantic and irrelevant distinction racists like to make) don’t usually support slavery (though some certainly do), but they are usually racist and believe in a degree of white supremacy (whether they’ll admit this or not). The American flag is a bit different. America has committed a number of atrocities, but many still believe in a kind of underlying American ideology of freedom and equality even if America itself does not and has not always embodied these qualities.</p>
