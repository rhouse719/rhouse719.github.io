<p>A common talking point from transphobes is that allowing trans women to use women’s restrooms will somehow make cisgender women less safe. Let’s take a look at how true this is and how policy derived from it affects trans woman.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-of-an-issue-is-this-really">How much of an issue is this really?</h2>
<p>While a number of <a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/114066/statistics-show-exactly-how-many-times-trans-people-have-attacked-you-in-bathrooms">sources</a> have claimed that there are zero instances of sex crimes of this type being committed, an article in “The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,” titled <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.29158/JAAPL.003761-18">The Transgender Bathroom Debate at the Intersection of Politics, Law, Ethics, and Science</a> was able to turn up a few. There were twenty in total occurring between 2003 and \2016. Fifteen of them happened in America and all but one were committed by a cisgender man pretending to be a woman. The remaining one was committed by a trans woman.</p>
<p>So is this really an issue? No, not really. Fifteen sex crimes, many less serious than rape or assault, over the course of more than a decade isn’t exactly an epidemic. To put that in perspective, there were 1,166,172 reported rapes over the same time period according to <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-1">FBI crime statistics</a>. So if all of these incidents had been rapes, they’d account for one thousandth of a percent (0.0013%) of the total. I wasn’t able to find the total number of sex crimes committed over this time period, but if you were to compare these fifteen incidents against that number, you’d get an even smaller percentage. On top of this, there is no evidence that prohibiting trans women from entering these spaces would actually have prevented any of those incidents.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-allowing-trans-women-in-womens-spaces-affect-crime-rates">How does allowing trans women in women’s spaces affect crime rates?</h2>
<p>It doesn’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt4rs4n6h0/qt4rs4n6h0.pdf">Gender Identity Nondiscrimination Laws in Public Accommodations: a Review of Evidence Regarding Safety and Privacy in Public Restrooms, Locker Rooms, and Changing Rooms</a></p>
<p>A study of various Massachusetts localities examined crime data from the years before and after localities passed gender identity inclusive public accommodations nondiscrimination ordinances (GIPANDOs). That data was then compared to data from localities without any such ordinances. The results showed that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The differences in incident rates over time (comparing before and after GIPANDO passage) were not statistically significant in the GIPANDO localities or among the matched localities. Most importantly, a Fisher’s exact test of the difference in crime rates between places with and without GIPANDOs before and after GIPANDOs were passed indicates no statistically significant relationship (at a one-sided alpha level of 0.10) between GIPANDO policy passage and victimization. A comparison of the change in the number of criminal incidents after passage of public accommodations protections between GIPANDO localities and their matchedlocalities also sh owed no statistically significant difference. In these comparisons, there does not appear to be a relationship between passage of GIPANDOs and criminal incidents in restrooms between localities.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-trans-women-affected-by-ordinances-that-ban-them-from-womens-restrooms">How are trans women affected by ordinances that ban them from women’s restrooms?</h2>
<p>So we know that there are very few incidents of trans women or men pretending to be cis or trans woman committing sex crimes in women-only spaces. We also know that prohibiting trans women from entering these spaces doesn’t actually prevent the incredibly small number of incidents that do happen. So what does banning trans women from women’s restrooms accomplish? It hurts trans women.</p>
<p>A study titled <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Restrooms-Minority-Stress-Jun-2013.pdf">Gendered Restrooms and Minority Stress: The Public Regulation of Gender and its Impact on Transgender People’s Lives</a> did a survey of trans people and found that 68% of respondents had been verbally harassed in public restrooms and 9% had been physically assaulted. 45% of them reported experiencing some kind of physical problem from trying to avoid using a public restroom.</p>
<p>A similar study, titled <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2F1468-0009.12127">Legal Protections in Public Accommodations Settings: A Critical Public Health Issue for Transgender and Gender-Nonconforming People</a>, showed that trans people that experienced public accommodations discrimination experienced worse mental health symptoms and were more likely to put off receiving care.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, 65% of respondents reported public accommodations discrimination in the past 12 months. The 5 most prevalent discrimination settings were transportation (36%), retail (28%), restaurants (26%), public gatherings (25%), and health care (24%). Public accommodations discrimination in the past 12 months in health care settings was independently associated with a 31% to 81% increased risk of adverse emotional and physical symptoms and a 2-fold to 3-fold increased risk of postponement of needed care when sick or injured and of preventive or routine health care, adjusting for discrimination in other public accommodations settings (which also conferred an additional 20% to 77% risk per discrimination setting endorsed).</p>
